## Example of a simple gen_server module ##
A simple gen_server project used as a skeleton for my projects, functions *func(1-3)/0* are there for testing purposes and for gen_server:cast/call sample invokes. Remove them in your production code.
Comments on return functions are useful for general help on return values. Created with references from: http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/gen_server_concepts.html
